# Scripts
Various useful scripts.

## To Do / Wishlist
**replaygain**:
- Capture echo statements in stdout log file. Possible solutions here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18460186/writing-outputs-to-log-file-and-console
- Capture stderr one line at a time.
- Add new arg for removing existing data (mp3gain does this already but this would be nice to have in my wrapper script, especially if I move on to non-mp3 files).
